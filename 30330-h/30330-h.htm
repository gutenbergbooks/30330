<h1><span class="sp1"><b>High Dragon Bump</b></span></h1>

<h2>BY DON THOMPSON</h2>

<div class="bk1"><i><big>If it took reduction or torch
hair, the Cirissins wanted a
bump. Hokum, thistle, gluck.</big></i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;young</span> and very beautiful
girl with golden blond hair and
smooth skin the color of creamed
sweet potatoes floated in the middle
of the windowless metal room into
which Wayne Brighton drifted.
The girl was not exactly naked, but
her few filmy clothes concealed
nothing.</p>

<p>Wayne cleared his throat, his apprehension
changing rapidly to confusion.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are going to <i>reduce</i> me?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"The word is seduce, mister," the
girl said. "They told me reduce,
too, but they don't talk real good,
and I think I'm supposed to seduce
you so you'll tell 'em something,
and then they'll let me go. I guess.
I hope. What is it they wantcha to
tell 'em?"</p>

<p>Wayne cleared his throat again,
striving merely to keep a firm grip
on his sanity. Things had been happening
much too fast for him to
have retained anything like his customary
composure.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, they want me to
get them a, uh&mdash;well, a high
dragon bump." He pronounced the
words carefully.</p>

<p>"So why dontcha?" the girl
asked.</p>

<p>Wayne's voice rose. "I don't even
know what it is. I told them and
they don't believe me. Now you're
here! I suppose if I can't be reduced&mdash;seduced&mdash;into
getting them
one, it will wind up with torch hair.
Believe me, I never heard of a high
dragon bump."</p>

<p>"Now, don't get panicky!" the
girl pleaded. "After all, I'm scared
too."</p>

<p>"I am not scared!" Wayne replied
indignantly. But he realized
that he was.</p>

<p>So far, in the hour or so he'd
been a captive of the Cirissins, he'd
managed to keep his fright pretty
well subdued. He'd understood almost
at once what had happened,
and his first reaction had not been
terror or even any great degree of
surprise.</p>

<p>He was a scientist and he had a
scientist's curiosity.</p>

<p>And at first the Cirissins&mdash;or the
one that had done all the talking&mdash;had
been cooperative in answering
his questions. But then, when he
wasn't able to comprehend what
they meant by high dragon bump,
they'd started getting impatient.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he asked
the girl. She was making gentle
swimming motions with her hands
and feet, moving gradually closer
to him.</p>

<p>"Sheilah," she said. "Sheilah
Ralue. I'm a model. I pose for
pitchers. You know&mdash;for sexy
magazines and calendars and stuff
like that."</p>

<p>"I see. You were posing
when&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"When they snatched me, yeah.
Couple hours ago, I guess. The
flash bulb went off and blinded me
for a second like it always does, and
I seemed to be falling. Then I was
here. Only I still don't even know
where here is. Do you? How come
we don't weigh nothing? It's
ghastly!"</p>

<p>"We're in a space ship," Wayne
told her. "In free fall, circling earth
a thousand miles or so out. I
thought you at least knew we were
in a space ship."</p>

<p>The girl said, "Oh, bull. We can't
be in no space ship. How'd we get
here so fast?"</p>

<p>"They have a matter transmitter,
but I haven't the slightest idea of
how it works. Obviously it's limited
to living creatures or they could just
as well have taken whatever it is
they want instead of ... You don't
happen to know what a high dragon
bump is, do you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be dumb. Of course I ...
well, unless it's a dance or something.
I use to be a dancer, ya
know. Sort of."</p>

<p>"With bubbles, I imagine,"
Wayne said.</p>

<p>"Tassels. They was my specialty.
But there's more money in posing
for pitchers, and the work ain't
quite so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I doubt that a high dragon
bump is a dance," Wayne said.</p>

<p>Then he rubbed his chin. High
dragon bump? Bumps and grinds?
Highland fling? Chinese dragon
dances? Hell, why not?</p>

<p>The idea of space travelers visiting
earth to learn a new dance was
no more fantastic than the idea of
them being here at all.</p>

<p>Wayne turned his face to the
door and shouted, "Hey, is that it?
A dance? You want us to teach you
a dance called the high dragon
bump?"</p>

<p>A muffled metallic voice from the
other side said, "Nod danz. Bump.
Huguff quig."</p>

<p>Wayne shrugged and grinned
weakly at Sheilah. "Well, we're
making headway. We know one
thing that it isn't."</p>

<p>The girl had drifted so close to
him now that he could feel the
warmth of her body and smell the
overwhelming fragrance of her perfume.</p>

<p>She put one hand on his arm,
and Wayne found that he had neither
the strength nor the inclination
to jerk away.</p>

<p>But he protested weakly, "Now,
listen, there's no point in you&mdash;I
mean&mdash;even if we did, I couldn't
produce a high dragon bump."</p>

<p>"What kind of work do you do,
mister?" Sheilah asked softly, drawing
herself even closer. "You know,
you ain't even told me your name
yet."</p>

<p>"It's Wayne," he said, fumbling
in an effort to loosen his tie so he
could breath more easily. "I'm an
instructor. I teach physics at Kyler
College, and I've got a weekly science
show on TV. In fact I'd just
finished my show when they got me.
I was leaving the studio, starting
down the stairs. Thought at first
I'd missed a step and was falling,
but I just kept falling. And I landed
here, and ... Now, don't do that!"</p>

<p>"Why, I wasn't doing nothing.
Whaddya do on your TV show?"</p>

<p>"I talk. About science. Physics.
Like today, I was discussing
the H-bomb. How it works, you
know, and why the fallout is dangerous,
and ... Oh, good Gawd!
Seduce, reduce! High dragon
bump!"</p>

<p>He shoved her away from him
abruptly and violently and he went
hurtling in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Well, hey!" Sheilah protested.
"You don't need to get so rough. I
wasn't going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," Wayne said. "I think
I've figured out what the Cirissins
want!</p>

<p>"Hey! Hey, open the door," he
shouted. "I've got to talk to you."</p>

<p>The door opened and a Cirissin
floated in.</p>

<p>Sheilah turned her head away,
shuddering, and Wayne found it
wise to close his eyes and open
them little by little to grow re-accustomed
to the sight gradually.</p>

<p>The only thing he could think of
with which to compare the Cirissins
was the intestinal complex of
an anemic elephant.</p>

<p>It was not an entirely satisfactory
comparison; but then, from his
point of view, the Cirissins were entirely
unsatisfactory creatures.</p>

<p>Each of the four he had seen was
nearly twice his size. They had no
recognizable features such as eyes,
ears, nose, head, arms or legs.</p>

<p>Tentacle-like protrusions of various
size and length seemed to serve
as the sensory and prehensile organs.
Wayne had identified one
waving, restless flexible stalk as the
eye. He suspected another of being
the mouth, except that it apparently
wasn't used for talking. The
voice came from somewhere deep
inside the convoluted mass of pastel-streaked
tissue.</p>

<p>"Wand tog?" the Cirissin rumbled.</p>

<p>Wayne said, "Yes. Do you mind
telling me what you want a high
dragon bump <i>for</i>?"</p>

<p>"Blast away hearth," the Cirissin
replied unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>Wayne swallowed and found it
unnaturally difficult to do so.</p>

<p>"To blast away earth?" he said.
"You can do that with just one
high dragon bump?"</p>

<p>"Certificate. Alteration energy
maguntoot. Compilated, though.
Want splain?"</p>

<p>Wayne said, "Never mind. I believe
you. Just tell me this: Why?
Who do you feel it's necessary to
do it?"</p>

<p>"Cause <i>is</i> necessary," the Cirissin
explained. "Hearth no good. Whee
dun lake. Godda gut red oft."</p>

<p>Sheilah gasped, "Why the inhuman
beasts!"</p>

<p>Wayne expended one sidelong silencing
glance on her and then said,
"I see. And just suppose now that I
don't give you a high dragon
bump? What do you do then?"</p>

<p>"Use hot tummy ache your
arnium fishing bumps. Got them us
elves. Tooking longthier, more hurtful,
but can. Few don't gives high
dragon bump tweddy far whores,
thin godda."</p>

<p>Wayne was silent for a while,
staring at the alien creature, aware
of Sheilah staring at him.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours," he muttered.
"Then they use uranium fission
bombs. Oh, hell!"</p>

<p>Finally he shrugged. "All right,
I'll do it. Anyway, I'll try. I'll do
what I can."</p>

<p>Sheilah said, "Hey, listen mister,
you can't ..."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Wayne snapped.
"How do you know what I can do?
You just let me handle this."</p>

<p>"No sea juicing?" the Cirissin
asked, waving his eye stem at
Sheilah.</p>

<p>"No. No sea juicing, and no
torch hair either, please. I just
didn't understand what you wanted
at first. Now, if I could talk to your
captain&mdash;or, are you the captain?"</p>

<p>The Cirissin replied, "I spoke
man. Name Orealgrailbliqu. Capitate
nod sparking merry can languish.
I only earning languish. Gut,
hah? Tree whacks."</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah, very good indeed,"
Wayne said. "And in only three
weeks! Now, Mr.&mdash;you don't mind
if I call you O'Reilly, do you? Well,
then, O'Reilly, do you have any
suggestions as to how I should go
about getting you a high dragon
bump? You want me to make you
one? Or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yukon mike?" O'Reilly asked.</p>

<p>Wayne shrugged modestly. "Of
course. With proper materials and
equipment&mdash;and enough time." He
wondered if there was any chance
at all of convincing O'Reilly of
that.</p>

<p>"Nod mush timeless," O'Reilly
said doubtfully. "God gut lab tarry,
few wand lug."</p>

<p>Wayne hesitated, partly to translate
O'Reilly's rumblings and partly
to marvel at an audacious idea
taking shape in his mind.</p>

<p>He said, "Uh, yes, by all means.
I <i>do</i> want to look at your laboratory.
Let's go."</p>

<p>The Cirissin offered no objections
to Sheilah accompanying
them, so they followed him, pulling
themselves along the tubular corridor
by means of metal rings set in
the walls, apparently for that specific
purpose.</p>

<p>It was the same means of propulsion
employed by their guide,
except that he used tentacles instead
of hands.</p>

<p>They were more awkward than
he, and so they fell behind.</p>

<p>"Listen, mister," Sheilah said.
"You're not really gonna help these
creeps, are ya? Cause, I mean, if
you are I'm gonna stop you&mdash;one
way or another."</p>

<p>Wayne looked at her, feeling a
deep sadness that anything so gorgeous
could be so stupid. Stirred to
self-consciousness by her near-nudity,
he glanced quickly away.</p>

<p>"Why don't you quit trying to
think?" he advised her. "I may not
be able to make a high dragon
bump, but so help me I'm going to
do my damnedest to see that they
get one. And don't you get any
stupid patriotic ideas. You just keep
out of it. Understand?"</p>

<p>O'Reilly had thrown open a door
and was waiting for them.</p>

<p>Wayne looked inside.</p>

<p>"Smatter? Dun lake lab tarry?"
the Cirissin asked after waiting
nearly a minute for some comment.</p>

<p>The laboratory probably wasn't
adequate to produce a hydrogen
bomb, Wayne realized; but he
wasn't at all sure. It was the
most complex, complete and compact
laboratory he had ever seen.
Its sheer size forced him to revise
upward his estimate of the overall
size of the ship.</p>

<p>Much of the equipment was
totally alien to him, but there was
also a great deal that he could at
least guess the purpose of. Including
a fabulous array of electronic
equipment.</p>

<p>When Wayne still didn't say anything,
the Cirissin closed the door.
"Batter blan," he announced.
"Wheeze india buck terth. Cup
girlish ear. Torch herf youdon
brink high dragon bump."</p>

<p>Wayne said, "Huh?"</p>

<p>"Flow me." O'Reilly led Wayne
and Sheilah through a maze of corridors,
tunnels and hatchways,
stopping at last to throw open a
door and let Wayne peer into the
control cabin of a miniature space
ship.</p>

<p>O'Reilly jumblingly explained
that it was a reconnaissance ship,
used for visiting the surface of a
planet when it was impractical to
land the mother ship.</p>

<p>The control board was simple: a
few dials, one or two buttons, several
switches and a view plate. It
looked too simple.</p>

<p>Wayne said, "Now, wait. Let's
see if I have this straight. You want
me to take this ship to earth and
swipe you a high dragon bump.
And you're going to keep Sheilah
here and torture her if I don't deliver
the goods, huh?"</p>

<p>The Cirissin said that was right.
"Kwiger butter. Jus bush piggest
putton. Token ley tours gutther."</p>

<p>"I see. And what about communications?"
Wayne asked. "Is
the boat equipped with radio?
How can I let you know when I
have your high dragon bump?"</p>

<p>O'Reilly said, "Can't. Combundlecations
Cirissin only."</p>

<p>From his further explanation
Wayne gathered that communications
between the two ships was on
the basis of some sort of amplified
brain waves, and could carry only
the brain waves of Cirissins.</p>

<p>Wayne considered the situation.</p>

<p>Two hours to get to earth. No
radio. The big Cirissin ship was circling
earth at an unknown distance,
unknown speed and unknown direction.
And although the ship was
enormous, it would be impossible to
spot it from earth unless you knew
exactly where to look.</p>

<p>He said, "It would really be better,
wouldn't it, if I could make the
high dragon bump right here?"</p>

<p>O'Reilly agreed that it would be
better.</p>

<p>"Well, let me try. You've got a
good lab, and we have plenty of
time. Twenty-four hours, you said?
Well, give me about ten hours in
the laboratory. If I can't produce a
high dragon bump in that time I'll
take the small ship down and get
you one. Okay?"</p>

<p>While the Cirissin thought it over
in meditative silence Wayne was
aware of Sheilah watching him
with cold, hostile eyes. He wished
he could explain things to her, but
he didn't dare try.</p>

<p>Finally O'Reilly said, "Hokum.
Tenners in lab. Thistle."</p>

<p>"It'll be enough," Wayne assured
him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Sheilah</span> was taken back to the
room where Wayne had met
her and the Cirissin instructed her
to stay there. He closed the door
but did not lock it. Then he took
Wayne back to the lab.</p>

<p>"Neediest hulp?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hulp? Help? Uh ... Why, no.
No, thanks. I can manage fine by
myself. In fact I'd rather work
alone. Fewer distractions the better,
you know."</p>

<p>"Hack saw lent. Wheel buzzy
preparation. In trol room few deriding
hulp needed." Then O'Reilly
floated out the door.</p>

<p>Wayne was astounded. He'd taken
it for granted that the Cirissin
would insist on supervising him,
and he'd been evolving elaborate
plans for escaping his attention.</p>

<p>But Wayne thought he had the
explanation for the Cirissins' idiotic
behavior.</p>

<p>This ship and everything about
it indicated an extremely high intelligence
and an advanced culture.</p>

<p>Everything, that is, but the Cirissins
themselves.</p>

<p>The idea of kidnapping him from
earth to provide them with a weapon
to destroy earth; kidnapping
Sheilah to seduce him; the idea of
even expecting him to be <i>able</i> to
produce such a weapon&mdash;it was all
idiotic.</p>

<p>There was only one explanation
that he could see.</p>

<p>The Cirissins <i>were</i> idiots.</p>

<p>Some other race had produced
this ship. These cosmic degenerates
had somehow gotten hold of it and
were on a mad binge through the
universe, destroying all the worlds
they didn't like.</p>

<p>He wondered how many they'd
already wiped out. They had to be
stopped.</p>

<p>Wayne immediately started constructing
a radio transmitter from
convenient materials in the laboratory.
It was fairly simple.</p>

<p>He was not interrupted for nearly
two hours. At which time he was
saying into his improvised microphone:</p>

<p>"Seven hours? That long? Can't
make it any sooner than that? Five
hours? Six?"</p>

<p>And then it was not a Cirissin
voice behind him which said:
"Drop that. Put up your hands and
turn around!"</p>

<p>It was Sheilah.</p>

<p>Wayne turned and saw her floating
at the doorway pointing a long,
tubular metal object at him, her
finger poised on a protruding lever.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Wayne asked.</p>

<p>Sheilah said, "It's a gun I found
after lookin' all over the damn ship.
I'm going to kill you. And then I'm
going to kill your Cirissin friends.
You're nothing but a dirty traitor,
and I wouldn't seduce you if&mdash;I
never did trust you scientists. Maybe
I'll be killed, too, but I don't
care." She was close to tears.</p>

<p>"You're going to kill me?"
Wayne said. "With that? How do
you know it's even a gun? Looks
more like a fire extinguisher to me.
Aw, you poor little imbecile, I
haven't had a chance to explain yet,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheilah said, "You make me
sick." She pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The object was not a fire extinguisher,
after all. It was quite
obviously a weapon of some kind.</p>

<p>Also it seemed obvious that
Sheilah had been pointing the
wrong end of the weapon toward
Wayne.</p>

<p>One more obvious fact that
Wayne had time to comprehend
was that the weapon was not a recoilless
type.</p>

<p>But by then Sheilah had gone
limp and the gun had rebounded
from her grasp and was sailing at
Wayne's head.</p>

<p>He ducked but not fast enough.
The object whacked him solidly
on top of his head.</p>

<p>His brain exploded into a display
of dazzling lights, excruciating
pain and deafening noise.</p>

<p>Then the lights went out and a
long, dense silence set in.</p>

<p>When Wayne fought through the
layers of renewed pain and opened
his eyes, he was still floating near
his makeshift radio equipment in
the laboratory.</p>

<p>Sheilah still hung limply in mid-air
near the door. The tubular
weapon wavered near the ceiling.
The radio transmitter was still
open.</p>

<p>It was just as though he'd been
unconscious no more than a few
minutes. But Wayne had a strong
feeling that it had been more than
that.</p>

<p>Therefore he was only shocked,
rather than stunned, when a glance
at his wristwatch indicated six
hours and forty minutes had
elapsed.</p>

<p>He held his head tightly in both
hands to keep it from flying off in
all directions at once, and he tried
to think.</p>

<p>He knew it was important to
think&mdash;fast and straight.</p>

<p>Six hours and forty minutes.</p>

<p>That was too long to be unconscious
from a simple blow on the
head, and his head didn't really
hurt that bad.</p>

<p>Probably the weapon had still
been firing whatever mysterious
ammunition it used when it struck
him; and when it bounced off his
head it had turned, and he'd been
caught in its blast.</p>

<p>But that didn't matter. That
wasn't the important thing.</p>

<p>Six hours and forty minutes he'd
been out.</p>

<p>Seven hours!</p>

<p>The Defense Department official
he'd spoken to had told him seven
hours.</p>

<p>And thank God it wasn't five
hours or six, as he'd been urging
them to make it.</p>

<p>Anyway he had only twenty minutes
now. Possibly a little more, but
just as likely less.</p>

<p>That realization should have
spurred him to instantaneous and
heroic action, but instead it paralyzed
him for several minutes. He
couldn't think what to do. He
couldn't get his muscles and nerves
functioning and coordinated.</p>

<p>The absence of gravity didn't
help. He thrashed about futilely.</p>

<p>But at last, almost by accident,
his feet touched a metal support
beam, and he pushed himself toward
Sheilah. He grabbed her
around the waist with one arm and
with his free hand pulled both of
them through the door.</p>

<p>It seemed a long, long time before
he got Sheilah to the reconnaissance
ship. By then the twenty
minutes were up. His life was going
into overtime.</p>

<p>Sheilah was conscious but still
disorganized and limp, struggling
weakly and ineffectually. Wayne
fumbled with the door, got it open
and shoved her inside.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself in and
closed the door.</p>

<p>They might make it yet. They
still had a chance.</p>

<p>He studied the control board, deciding
on the proper button to push.</p>

<p>From behind him Sheilah
screamed, "The bomb! You've got
the bomb and you're going to&mdash;Well,
you're not!"</p>

<p>Her body slammed against his
shoulders and her arms encircled
his neck. Her fingers clawed at his
eyes.</p>

<p>Wayne struggled, not to free himself,
but only to get one hand loose,
to reach the control board. When
he did get a hand free, they had
floated too far from the controls.</p>

<p>"Stop it, you stupid bitch!"
Wayne snarled. "You're going to
kill us both!"</p>

<p>Wayne said, "Listen, there's a
guided missile from earth heading
straight for this ship, and it has a
hydrogen bomb warhead. It'll get
here any minute now and when
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words were broken off by the
tremendous roar and concussion of
the hydrogen bomb.</p>

<p>Wayne's last thought before oblivion
swallowed him was that they
wouldn't have had time to escape,
anyway.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the end. Wayne
woke up enough to refuse to believe
he was alive, and O'Reilly was
somewhere near, telling him:</p>

<p>"Cirissins full of grate your forts.
Radio eggulant blan. Thankel
normous. Rid of earth now. Blasted
away. Givish <i>good</i> high dragon
bump. Yukon gome now."</p>

<p>Wayne groaned. The meaning of
O'Reilly's words was trying to get
through to his brain, and he was
trying desperately to keep the
meaning out.</p>

<p>O'Reilly's voice receded into a
thick gray fog. "Keep shib. Shores.
Presirent felpings. Gluck."</p>

<p>Metal slammed against metal.
Wayne slammed against something
hard. And darkness closed in once
again.</p>

<p>But this time it wasn't so smothering
and didn't last nearly so long.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes his head
was clear. He wasn't floating. He
was lying on something hard&mdash;a
floor surface of the Cirissin landing
ship. He didn't ache anywhere.</p>

<p>All in all he felt pretty good.</p>

<p>For the first few seconds.</p>

<p>Then he started remembering
things, and he wished he hadn't
bothered to wake up.</p>

<p>Sheilah was standing by the control
panel, her back to him. She
blocked the view screen, but Wayne
didn't want to see it anyway. He
wasn't even curious.</p>

<p>Sheilah turned, saw him, smiled
broadly.</p>

<p>She said, "Gee, mister, I guess
you're a hero. I dunno how you
done it, but you made 'em go away,
and you made 'em turn us loose."
Wayne could detect no mockery or
bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up," he growled.</p>

<p>"You still mad at me cause of
what I done? Well, gee, I'm sorry.
I didn't get whatcha were up to. I
guess I still don't, but ... Oh, hell,
let's don't fight about it. It don't
matter now, does it?"</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head wearily.
"No," he agreed. "It doesn't matter
now."</p>

<p>Sheilah moved away from the
control board and came toward
him. In her filmy, transparent costume,
she was the quintessence of
womanly allure.</p>

<p>Wayne gasped and stared, but
not at her.</p>

<p>The view screen had become visible
when she'd moved.</p>

<p>It showed earth.</p>

<p>Or a curved, cloud-veiled slice
of earth. Intact, serene and growing
steadily larger.</p>

<p>"What the hell! Why, I thought ..."
Wayne jumped to his feet,
brushed past Sheilah and peered
more closely at the view plate.
There was no mistaking it. Earth.</p>

<p>"What's a matter with you,
mister?" Sheilah asked.</p>

<p>Wayne felt dizzy. O'Reilly had
said, "Earth blasted away," hadn't
he? And the H-bomb hadn't destroyed
the Cirissin ship. Therefore ...
Well, therefore what?</p>

<p>In the first place what O'Reilly
had actually said was, "Rid of
earth now. Blasted away." It wasn't
quite the same as ...</p>

<p>O'Reilly had never said anything
about <i>destroying</i> earth.</p>

<p>Quite a sizeable re-evaluation
project was taking place in Wayne's
mind. It took several minutes for
all the pieces to fall into their proper
places. But once he was willing
to realize that the Cirissins had
known what they were doing, everything
seemed obvious.</p>

<p>"Oh, good Gawd!" he muttered.
"What utter idiots!"</p>

<p>"The Cirissins?" Sheilah asked.</p>

<p>"No, I mean us. Me. Good Lord,
just because O'Reilly's English
wasn't perfect! What did I expect
for only three weeks? Hummm.
The atomic structure of the entire
ship must be uniformly charged to ...
Damn! High dragon bump!"</p>

<p>"I don't getcha," Sheilah said.
"What's with this high dragon
bump business? I thought they
wanted a hydrogen bomb to destroy
earth, and I thought you'd
agreed to help 'em, and so I
thought ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," Wayne said.
"I know what you thought, and you
weren't any more stupid than I
was. We were both wrong.</p>

<p>"Look, the Cirissins must have
been stalled&mdash;out of gas, sort of.
Something had gone wrong with
their nuclear drive units. They had
some emergency fuel, but they
didn't want to use it. Like having
a can of kerosene in the car when
the tank runs dry, I suppose. It will
work, but it messes up the engine.
You understand so far?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Okay then. They happened to
be close to earth, so they went into
an orbit around it and studied it
for a while on radio and TV bands,
and realized they might be able to
get help without using their emergency
fuel&mdash;uranium, incidentally,
not kerosene.</p>

<p>"So they grabbed us. Me, I suppose
because they'd seen my TV
science program. They must have
gotten the idea from some stupid
spy show that scientists have to be
seduced into revealing information.
That's why they picked up you."</p>

<p>Sheilah interrupted, "But what
did they <i>want</i>? I thought ..."</p>

<p>Patiently, Wayne said, "Just
what they said. A high dragon
bump. A <i>bump</i>, not a bomb. A
boost, a push. Not to blast away
earth, but to blast away <i>from</i> earth.
That's all."</p>
